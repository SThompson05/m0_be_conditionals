# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

When you want the outputs to be specific to what is being evaluated.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

Nothing. For the most part this was pretty straight forward and I didn't do anything
to outlandish that I regret. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

Conditionals are my jam. I might not be the best at them, but they feel satisfying
especially when they operate when they should. If feels like we're coding.
